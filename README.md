This project demonstrates my ability to create multiple functions that all intertwine to create a random password that populates into the user view directly from my javascript file to the html file via DOM manipulation. It also shows my ability to manipulate strings, along with the user experience via the use of window prompts and alerts detailing any user input that was received along with whether or not they fit the designated parameters I gave the user. It demonstrates recursion without breaking the code via infinite loops and a strong understanding of syntax for if/if else statements showing that I understand how control flow works and can help organize code.
